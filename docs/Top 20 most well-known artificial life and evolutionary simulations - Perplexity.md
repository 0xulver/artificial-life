Perfect! I've completed a comprehensive research document covering the **top 20 most well-known artificial life and evolutionary simulations**. Here's what I've compiled for you:

## Summary of Key Systems Covered:

**Cellular Automata (Foundational):**
1. **Conway's Game of Life** - The classic foundation
2. **Lenia** - Continuous evolution with 400+ discovered species
3. **Rule 110** - Simplest Turing-complete system
4. **Brian's Brain** - 3-state elegant variant
5. **Smooth Life** - Smooth continuous generalization

**Agent-Based & Physics Simulations:**
6. **Boids** - Flocking behavior with 3 rules
7. **Langton's Ant** - Single agent creating chaos & order
8. **Virtual Creatures (Sims)** - 3D evolving bodies & brains
9. **Particle Life** - Simple particle interactions, complex ecosystems

**Digital Evolution Systems:**
10. **Tierra** - First major digital organism system
11. **Avida** - Improved Tierra with task rewards
12. **Predator-Prey Systems** - Coevolutionary arms races

**Modern Neural Systems:**
13. **Neural Cellular Automata** - Learnable self-organizing patterns
14. **Neural Particle Automata** - Latest particle-based evolution
15. **ASAL** - AI-discovered new artificial life rules

**Plus:** Wolfram cellular automata taxonomy, life-like variants, evolutionary algorithms, stigmergy/ant systems, and morphogenesis systems.

## Document Includes:

✅ **Detailed descriptions** of each system  
✅ **Key emergent properties and behaviors**  
✅ **Implementation complexity ratings**  
✅ **Specific GitHub repositories and examples** (mostly in C++, Python, JavaScript)  
✅ **Research papers and references**  
✅ **Implementation hierarchy by difficulty** (Very Easy to Very Hard)  
✅ **Technology recommendations** for visualization and simulation  
✅ **Performance considerations** for your visualization layer

The document is saved as `alife_simulations_research.md` and ready for you to download. You can now use this to:

1. **Choose which systems to implement** based on complexity vs. visual interest
2. **Find reference implementations** on GitHub in various languages
3. **Understand the core algorithms** for each system
4. **Plan your agentic code translation** strategy (start with simple pseudocode, have agents generate optimized code)
5. **Explore combinations** of different systems

Since you're planning to rewrite visualizations anyway, I'd recommend starting with one of the simpler systems (Game of Life, Boids, or Particle Life) to get the core simulation loop working, then gradually add more complex ones. **Lenia** and **Neural Cellular Automata** would give you the most visually striking and interesting behaviors for demonstration purposes.
